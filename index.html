As if all that wasn't enough, he was also a fine rugby player, golfer, and tennis player.Outside of SA colours, de Villiers was also a batting legend in T20 leagues worldwide, especially in the IPL for Royal Challengers Bangalore - for whom he made nearly 5000 runs at a strike rate of 158.63 in 11 seasons. <br><br></P>
